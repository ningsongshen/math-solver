An advanced calculator

## Usage

Open up calculator/index.html in your browser! The JavaScript calculator just works. No fuss.

Or, look at the other files that include some nice functions that I learned about.

### Known Issues

When the operators are clicked after the user has already completed an operation, the equals sign does not revert from the AC. This is annoying.
